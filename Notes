Constant :
1. when the value is known prior to execution and directly written into the code.
2.use upper case for constants that are “hard-coded”.
3. use small case for constant that is calculated at runtime

DataType
1.A value in JavaScript is always of a certain type.
2.There are eight basic data types in JavaScript.

a variable can at one moment be a string and then store a number:
Programming languages that allow such things, such as JavaScript, are called “dynamically typed”, meaning that there exist data types, but variables are not bound to any of them.


number type represents both integer and floating point number
NaN represents a computational error.
Infinity represents the mathematical Infinity ∞.
BigInt value is created by appending n to the end of an integer


The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”.
